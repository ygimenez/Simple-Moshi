## Can I contribute? 

Yes, anyone can contribute, be it with issue report or active development. However, care must be taken - you have freedom, but it's up to me to accept merge requests, so refrain from doing troll modifications.

## I like this library, can I fork it and work on my own?

Sure, but I'll not be responsible nor offer continuous support for non-official derivatives.
